# Data Engineer Salaries Report

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project explores salary trends for Data Engineers and related roles. The analysis was carried out using Power BI and is based on an open dataset containing information about salaries, job titles, company size, work type, and locations. The dashboard is designed to give a clear, interactive view of how compensation levels vary across different dimensions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- To track average salaries of data engineers over time.  
- To compare salaries by employment type, experience level, job title, company size, and location.  
- To highlight the distribution of engineers, including the growth of remote roles.  
- To provide a tool that supports quick insights for professionals, recruiters, and researchers.  

## ðŸ“Š Results
- **Average salary** is around **$149.7K**, showing a slight decline (-2.63%) year-on-year.  
- The number of engineers in the dataset grew sharply, with **16,534 entries**, and remote roles now account for over **5,100 engineers**.  
- Salaries differ strongly by employment type: full-time roles average the highest pay, while freelance and part-time roles earn much less.  
- Job titles show wide salary variation, with senior and specialised roles (e.g., Data Science Tech Lead, Cloud Architect, Analytics Engineering Manager) commanding the highest pay.  
- Larger companies tend to offer better salaries than small companies.  
- Location continues to be a strong factor in pay differences.  

## âœ… Conclusions
- Data engineering salaries remain high overall but show signs of softening in recent years.  
- Remote work is well-established, though compensation still varies widely by role and company.  
- The dashboard provides a practical way to explore these patterns interactively and can support career planning, hiring strategies, and labour market research.
