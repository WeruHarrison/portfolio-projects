**Goal**

The aim of this project is to clean the Spotify 2024 dataset. The input is a raw uncleaned Spotify data and the output is a tidy dataset. The source of the data is this [kaggle project.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pranalibose/data-cleaning-and-eda-on-spotify-data) 

**Skills**

Problem solving, researching, critical thinking, data transformation using select(), mutate(), group_by(), filter() etc

**Tools**

Tidyverse (R-programming)

**Results**

The ouput dataset did not have duplicates or missing values. All variables had appropriate class (or type) and each value was in its own cell. 

**Lesson**

I learned how to use trial and error to try different solutions before selecting the best alternative. I need to improve on the cleanness of the code. I also need to improve on cleaning strings.
