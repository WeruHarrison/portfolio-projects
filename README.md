# Portfolio Projects
This repo contains all of the data analysis projects I have done. 

1. World Population Analysis
In this project, I looked at population trends and patterns from 1960 to 2020. I relied on the tidyverse package in R-programming for data transformation and visualisation. Through the project, I practices joining datasets using `left-join()` and `merge()`, filtering and selecting variables, and subseting data frames. I also practiced converting long format longitudinal data to wide format for easy visualisation. Something I need to improve in subsequent projects is modifying the aesthetics and other options of ggplots to produce good looking visualisations.
